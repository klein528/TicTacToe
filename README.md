<h1>Installation</h1>
<p>You need to have git installed in your local mashine to use this type of installation.</p>

<p>Clone the repository by: https://github.com/klein528/TicTacToe.git</p>

<h1>Usage</h1>
<p> This project is a simple TicTacToe game, it will only work for player vs player.</p>

<p> The player can choose between the symbols "X" and "O" and if the game is over you can click on the "Reset" button at the bottom.</p>

<p> I made this project purely for my learning purpose.</p>

<h1>important note</h1>

<p>I could not code the AI opponent because it took too much time, especially the 'unbeatable' AI opponent. I have more important tasks in my coding journey right now. Maybe I will continue this project later in my career.</p>


<h1>Contribution</h1>
<p>This repository is open to contribute. Please be free to copy my code or share any kind of new ideas for my project.</p>
